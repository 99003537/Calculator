# 4W and 1H
4W AND 1H OF CALCULATOR
WHAT 
Multipurpose calculator is an electronic calculator, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering and mathematics. They are widely used in both educational and professional fields.
It generally stores the data of the previous results even if the new calculation is carried out.
It includes the features such as
Logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e
It has trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions
Exponential and square root functions
Constants values such as pi 
It has scientific notations
Matrix calculations  
WHY MULTIPURPOSE CALCULATOR IS USED?
They have the quick access to mathematical functions
It make solving difficult problems quicker and easier
It has a built-in memory, which allows us to store certain equations
WHEN
Main features of a scientific calculator and encourages you to use your calculator, both for
everyday arithmetic and for more complicated calculations that use the function keys as well.
Key sequences, which describe which keys to press, are included in all the activities, so you
can try out the ideas straightaway.
WHERE
Calculator is a part of everyone day to day life and it is used in many places from simple
calculation to the most critical one.
HOW
Calculators will accept the input, through the input keys and perform the required operations
And if the input or the key were selected an incorrect way it displays a message ERROR and if inputs were clear calculator performs operations such as arithmetic, exponential and logical operations and displays the output based on the keys we selected.It can be used with the numbers along with defined functions required for the computations.
